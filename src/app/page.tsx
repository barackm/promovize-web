        Introduction Welcome to the Next.js documentation! What is Next.js?
        Next.js is a framework for building web applications. With Next.js, you
        can build user interfaces using React components. Then, Next.js provides
        additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application.
        Under the hood, Next.js also abstracts and automatically configures
        tooling for you, like bundling, compiling, and more. This allows you to
        focus on building your application instead of spending time setting up
        tooling. Whether you re an individual developer or part of a larger
        team, Next.js can help you build interactive, dynamic, and fast web
        applications. Main Features Some of the main Next.js features include:
        Feature Description Routing A file-system based router built on top of
        Server Components that supports layouts, nested routing, loading states,
        error handling, and more. Rendering Client-side and Server-side
        Rendering with Client and Server Components. Further optimized with
        Static and Dynamic Rendering on the server with Next.js. Streaming on
        Edge and Node.js runtimes. Data Fetching Simplified data fetching with
        async/await support in React Components and the fetch()s API that aligns
        with React and the Web Platform. Styling Support for your preferred
        styling methods, including CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, and CSS-in-JS
        Optimizations Image, Fonts, and Script Optimizations to improve your
        applications Core Web Vitals and User Experience. Typescript Improved
        support for TypeScript, with better type checking and more efficient
        compilation, as well as custom TypeScript Plugin and type checker. API
        Reference Updates to the API design throughout Next.js. Please refer to
        the API Reference Section for new APIs. How to Use These Docs The
        sections and pages of the docs are organized sequentially, from basic to
        advanced, so you can follow them step-by-step when building your Next.js
        application. However, you can read them in any order or skip to the
        pages that apply to your use case. At the top of the sidebar, you ll
        notice a dropdown menu that allows you to switch between the App Router
        the Pages Router features. Since there are features that are unique to
        each directory, its important to keep track of which tab is selected. On
        the right side of the page, you ll see a table of contents that makes it
        easier to navigate between sections of a page. The breadcrumbs at the
        top of the page will also indicate whether youre viewing App Router docs
        or Pages Router docs. To get started, checkout the Installation. If
        youre new to React or Server Components, we recommend reading the React
        Essentials page. Pre-Requisite Knowledge Although our docs are designed
        to be beginner-friendly, we need to establish a baseline so that the
        docs can stay focused on Next.js functionality. Well make sure to
        provide links to relevant documentation whenever we introduce a new
        concept. To get the most out of our docs, its recommended that you have
        a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and React. If you need to brush up
        on your React skills, check out these resources: React: Official React
        Documentation React Essentials Accessibility For optimal accessibility
        when using a screen reader while reading the docs, we recommend using
        Firefox and NVDA, or Safari and VoiceOver. Join our Community If you
        have questions about anything related to Next.js, youre always welcome
        to ask our community on GitHub Discussions, Discord, Twitter, and
        Reddit. Getting Started Learn how to create full-stack web applications
        with Next.js. App Router Use the new App Router with Next.js and Reacts
        latest features, including Layouts, Server Components, Suspense, and
        more. Pages Router Before Next.js 13, the Pages Router was the main way
        to create routes in Next.js with an intuitive file-system router.

        Next.js documentation! What is Next.js? Next.js is a framework for
        building web applications. With Next.js, you can build user interfaces
        using React components. Then, Next.js provides additional structure,
        features, and optimizations for your application. Under the hood,
        Next.js also abstracts and automatically configures tooling for you,
        like bundling, compiling, and more. This allows you to focus on building
        your application instead of spending time setting up tooling. Whether
        you re an individual developer or part of a larger team, Next.js can
        help you build interactive, dynamic, and fast web applications. Main
        Features Some of the main Next.js features include: Feature Description
        Routing A file-system based router built on top of Server Components
        that supports layouts, nested routing, loading states, error handling,
        and more. Rendering Client-side and Server-side Rendering with Client
        and Server Components. Further optimized with Static and Dynamic
        Rendering on the server with Next.js. Streaming on Edge and Node.js
        runtimes. Data Fetching Simplified data fetching with async/await
        support in React Components and the fetch()s API that aligns with React
        and the Web Platform. Styling Support for your preferred styling
        methods, including CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, and CSS-in-JS
        Optimizations Image, Fonts, and Script Optimizations to improve your
        applications Core Web Vitals and User Experience. Typescript Improved
        support for TypeScript, with better type checking and more efficient
        compilation, as well as custom TypeScript Plugin and type checker. API
        Reference Updates to the API design throughout Next.js. Please refer to
        the API Reference Section for new APIs. How to Use These Docs The
        sections and pages of the docs are organized sequentially, from basic to
        advanced, so you can follow them step-by-step when building your Next.js
        application. However, you can read them in any order or skip to the
        pages that apply to your use case. At the top of the sidebar, you ll
        notice a dropdown menu that allows you to switch between the App Router
        the Pages Router features. Since there are features that are unique to
        each directory, its important to keep track of which tab is selected. On
        the right side of the page, you ll see a table of contents that makes it
        easier to navigate between sections of a page. The breadcrumbs at the
        top of the page will also indicate whether youre viewing App Router docs
        or Pages Router docs. To get started, checkout the Installation. If
        youre new to React or Server Components, we recommend reading the React
        Essentials page. Pre-Requisite Knowledge Although our docs are designed
        to be beginner-friendly, we need to establish a baseline so that the
        docs can stay focused on Next.js functionality. Well make sure to
        provide links to relevant documentation whenever we introduce a new
        concept. To get the most out of our docs, its recommended that you have
        a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and React. If you need to brush up
        on your React skills, check out these resources: React: Official React
        Documentation React Essentials Accessibility For optimal accessibility
        when using a screen reader while reading the docs, we recommend using
        Firefox and NVDA, or Safari and VoiceOver. Join our Community If you
